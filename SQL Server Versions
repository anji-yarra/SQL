1. Mainstream Support

Duration: First 5 years after product release (typically).

What it includes:
Security updates
Non-security updates (bug fixes, performance improvements)
New features or enhancements
Free support (if applicable, or with Software Assurance)
Warranty claims and design changes

Think of it as full support — you're getting both new improvements and fixes.

2. Extended Support
Duration: Next 5 years after Mainstream ends (total = 10 years).

What it includes:
Security updates only
Paid support only (no free support)
No new features or design changes
No warranty claims

This is limited support — mostly for security updates only, to keep systems safe while you plan for upgrade/migration.
